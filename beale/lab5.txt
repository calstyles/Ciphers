a.Having the arguments contained within a struct allows for the program to agree
on the types throughout. The detriments of this implementation would be its lack of 
variation within the program. 

b.In order to make the cipher harder to crack, we could encript more than 
just alphabetical characters. This would make the cipher more complex and 
harder for someone to track a pattern on how sentences are formed.
 
c.The caesar cipher is very basic and would only be useful to learn basic encription.
The vigenere cipher was a step up from the caesar cipher since it requires a specific
key that manipulates the rotation numbers and not just what each character represents.
The Beale cipher is a lot more complicated than the other two and can actually be made
to hide something that would be difficult to crack. It shares the similar flaw
with the caesar cipher where characters are mapped to the same numbers. The Beale
cipher does have more features that could help keep something protected.

d.I would say with our current implementation we would fail without having the
exact files which would defeat the entire purpose of encription.
